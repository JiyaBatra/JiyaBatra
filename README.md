## Hi there 👋

<# 💫 About Me:
1) I am currently working on: Developing full-stack projects with the MERN stack, including refining CodeVibe for better functionality and UI.<br><br>2) I am looking to collaborate on: Web development projects, open-source contributions, and building interactive, user-friendly applications.<br><br>3) I am currently learning: Advanced React concepts, JavaScript optimization, and improving my DSA skills for efficient coding.<br><br>4) Ask about me: Feel free to ask about my projects, programming journey, or web development techniques—I love discussing code and problem-solving approaches.<br><br>5) Fun fact: I once built a Spotify clone and a Notes website from scratch, purely in HTML and CSS, just to challenge my layout and design skills.
